## Exercise 1

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
key: 07ea54b341
lang: python
xp: 100
skills: 2
```

In this case study, we will continue taking a look at patterns of flight for each of the three birds in our dataset. We will group the flight patterns by bird and date, and plot the mean altitude for these groupings.

`pandas` makes it easy to perform basic operations on groups within a dataframe without needing to loop through each value in the dataframe. In this exercise, we will group the dataframe by `birdname` and then find the average `speed_2d` for each bird.

`@instructions`
- Fill in the code to find the mean altitudes of each bird.

`@hint`
- `grouped_birds` contains a column called `altitude`.  Find the mean of this column!

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}
data_filepath = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_974/datasets/"
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
birddata = pd.read_csv(data_filepath + "bird_tracking.csv")
birddata.date_time = pd.to_datetime(birddata.date_time)
birddata["date"] = birddata.date_time.dt.date
grouped_bydates = birddata.groupby(["bird_name", "date"])

```

`@sample_code`
```{python}
# First, use `groupby()` to group the data by "bird_name".
grouped_birds =

# Now calculate the mean of `speed_2d` using the `mean()` function.
mean_speeds = 

# Use the `head()` method prints the first 5 lines of each bird.


# Find the mean `altitude` for each bird.
mean_altitudes = 

```

`@solution`
```{python}
# First, use `groupby()` to group the data by "bird_name".
grouped_birds = birddata.groupby("bird_name")

# Now calculate the mean of `speed_2d` using the `mean()` function.
mean_speeds = grouped_birds.speed_2d.mean()

# Use the `head()` method prints the first 5 lines of each bird.
grouped_birds.head()

# Find the mean `altitude` for each bird.
mean_altitudes = grouped_birds.altitude.mean()

```

`@sct`
```{python}
test_student_typed("grouped_birds.head()",
              pattern=False,
              not_typed_msg="Did you make sure to check the head of your dataset?")  
test_object("mean_altitudes",
            undefined_msg = "Did you define `mean_altitudes`?",
            incorrect_msg = "It looks like `mean_altitudes` wasn't defined correctly.")
success_msg("Great work!")
```

## Exercise 2

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
key: 88166cd5b1
lang: python
xp: 100
skills: 2
```

In this case study, we will continue taking a look at patterns of flight for each of the three birds in our dataset. We will group the flight patterns by bird and date, and plot the mean altitude for these groupings.

In this exercise, we will group the flight times by date and calculate the mean altitude within that day.

`@instructions`
- Convert `birddata.date_time` to the `pd.datetime` format, and store as `birddata["date"]`.
-  Fill in the code to find the mean altitudes for each day.

`@hint`
- The function `pd.to_datetime()` will convert dates to a `datetime` objects.
- For `mean_altitudes_perday`, you can use the `mean()` method on `grouped_bydates.altitude`.
- See `?pd.DataFrame.groupby` for help!

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}
data_filepath = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_974/datasets/"
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
birddata = pd.read_csv(data_filepath + "bird_tracking.csv")
```

`@sample_code`
```{python}
# Convert birddata.date_time to the `pd.datetime` format.
birddata.date_time = 

# Create a new column of day of observation
birddata["date"] = 

# Check the head of the column.


# Use `groupby()` to group the data by date.
grouped_bydates = 

# Find the mean `altitude` for each date.
mean_altitudes_perday =

```

`@solution`
```{python}
# Convert birddata.date_time to the `pd.datetime` format.
birddata.date_time = pd.to_datetime(birddata.date_time)

# Create a new column of day of observation
birddata["date"] = birddata.date_time.dt.date

# Check the head of the column.
birddata.date.head()

# Use `groupby()` to group the data by date.
grouped_bydates = birddata.groupby("date")

# Find the mean `altitude` for each date.
mean_altitudes_perday = grouped_bydates.altitude.mean()

```

`@sct`
```{python}
test_student_typed("head",
              pattern=False,
              not_typed_msg="Did you make sure to check the head of your dataset?")  
test_object("mean_altitudes_perday",
            undefined_msg = "Did you define `mean_altitudes_perday`?",
            incorrect_msg = "It looks like `mean_altitudes_perday` wasn't defined correctly.")
success_msg("Great work!")
```

## Exercise 3

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
key: d421739915
lang: python
xp: 100
skills: 2
```

In this case study, we will continue taking a look at patterns of flight for each of the three birds in our dataset. We will group the flight patterns by bird and date, and plot the mean altitude for these groupings.

In this exercise, we will group the flight times by both bird and date, and calculate the mean altitude for each.

`@instructions`
- `birddata` already contains the `date` column.  To find the average speed for each bird and day, create a new grouped dataframe called `grouped_birdday` that groups the data by both `bird_name` and `date`.

`@hint`
- When grouping by more than one column, remember to use a `list`.
- See `?pd.DataFrame.groupby` for help!

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}
data_filepath = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_974/datasets/"
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
birddata = pd.read_csv(data_filepath + "bird_tracking.csv")
birddata.date_time = pd.to_datetime(birddata.date_time)
birddata['date'] = birddata.date_time.dt.date
```

`@sample_code`
```{python}
# Use `groupby()` to group the data by bird and date.
grouped_birdday = 

# Find the mean `altitude` for each bird and date.
mean_altitudes_perday =

# look at the head of `mean_altitudes_perday`.


```

`@solution`
```{python}
# Use `groupby()` to group the data by bird and date.
grouped_birdday = birddata.groupby(["bird_name", "date"])

# Find the mean `altitude` for each bird and date.
mean_altitudes_perday = grouped_birdday.altitude.mean()

# look at the head of `mean_altitudes_perday`.
mean_altitudes_perday.head()

```

`@sct`
```{python}
test_object("mean_altitudes_perday",
            undefined_msg = "Did you define `mean_altitudes_perday`?",
            incorrect_msg = "It looks like `mean_altitudes_perday` wasn't defined correctly.")
test_student_typed("head",
              pattern=False,
              not_typed_msg="Did you make sure to check the head of your dataset?")              
success_msg("Great work!")
```

## Exercise 4

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
key: 98d1b86767
lang: python
xp: 100
skills: 2
```

In this case study, we will continue taking a look at patterns of flight for each of the three birds in our dataset. We will group the flight patterns by bird and date, and plot the mean altitude for these groupings.

Great!  Now find the average speed for each bird and day.

`@instructions`
-  Store these are three `pandas` Series objects â€“ one for each bird.
-  Use the plotting code provided to plot the average speeds for each bird.

`@hint`
- To find the average, consider how you to use `speed_2d` and `mean` for all three birds.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}
data_filepath = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_974/datasets/"
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
birddata = pd.read_csv(data_filepath + "bird_tracking.csv")
birddata.date_time = pd.to_datetime(birddata.date_time)
birddata["date"] = birddata.date_time.dt.date
grouped_birdday = birddata.groupby(["bird_name", "date"])
```

`@sample_code`
```{python}
eric_daily_speed  = # Enter your code here.
sanne_daily_speed = # Enter your code here.
nico_daily_speed  = # Enter your code here.

eric_daily_speed.plot(label="Eric")
sanne_daily_speed.plot(label="Sanne")
nico_daily_speed.plot(label="Nico")
plt.legend(loc="upper left")
plt.show()

```

`@solution`
```{python}
eric_daily_speed  = grouped_birdday.speed_2d.mean()["Eric"]
sanne_daily_speed = grouped_birdday.speed_2d.mean()["Sanne"]
nico_daily_speed  = grouped_birdday.speed_2d.mean()["Nico"]

eric_daily_speed.plot(label="Eric")
sanne_daily_speed.plot(label="Sanne")
nico_daily_speed.plot(label="Nico")
plt.legend(loc="upper left")
plt.show()

```

`@sct`
```{python}
test_object("eric_daily_speed",
            undefined_msg = "Did you define `eric_daily_speed`?",
            incorrect_msg = "It looks like `df` wasn't defined correctly.")
test_object("sanne_daily_speed",
            undefined_msg = "Did you define `sanne_daily_speed`?",
            incorrect_msg = "It looks like `sanne_daily_speed` wasn't defined correctly.")
test_object("nico_daily_speed",
            undefined_msg = "Did you define `nico_daily_speed`?",
            incorrect_msg = "It looks like `nico_daily_speed` wasn't defined correctly.")
test_student_typed("plt.show",
              pattern=False,
              not_typed_msg="Did you use `plt.show`?")       
success_msg("Great work!  This concludes the case study.  You can return to the course through this link:  https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+PH526x+1T2018")
